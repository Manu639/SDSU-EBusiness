        <p>The Buen Retiro Park, Retiro Park or simply El Retiro is one of the largest parks of the city of Madrid, Spain. The park belonged to the Spanish Monarchy until the late 19th century, when it became a public park.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Secret bonus: There is a structure called The Cristal Palace inside the park with a cupola that reaches a 22 metres height that you can visit too!</p>
